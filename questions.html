        <h2> Question I Hope to Address Through the Podcast </h2>
	<p>
		Ethics and Public Opinion

	• Eugenics
		○ History (what was Galton onto?)
		○ Implicit evaluation of counterfactual lives; is this issue at all related to the ethics of abortion? 
		○ Nicholas Agar, Savulescu --> Procreative Beneficence
	• History of science (how did we get to IVF)? 
	• Cross-cultural comparison —> Denmark vs US
	• Graying of the population and demographic concerns
	• Cognitive vs. disease trait selection
	• The jump from aneuploidy to monogenic disorders, and from monogenic to polygenic disorders.
	• Maintaining beneficial diversity, e.g. cognitive diversity and ASD. --> Is there actually a tradeoff there, or can we have our lunch and eat it too?
	• Realistically, once the cat is out of the bag, and supposing we believe genetic engineering is wrong, is there any way to solve the CAP (e.g., is there any way to enforce a complete ban on the technology)?
	• How great would the disease reduction/positive trait augmentation have to be for X% of prospective parents to adopt this technology?
	• PGT could be considered a form of indirect genetic engineering. From the perspective of the public, does this make it more ethically permissible than direct genetic engineering?
	• What is intuitions underlie people's opposition to PGT and how can we shift these intuitions: people clearly are not pure utility maximizers. 
	• How will this change our beliefs about free will and attributions of moral responsibility (I read some papers on this —how genetic explanations impact attributions of culpability —when writing my honor's thesis).
		

Efficacy
	• Pleiotropy and unforeseen consequences: Precautionary principle: is there any truly free lunch?
		○ Can we deduce how pleiotropy will be from evolutionary first principles, or is the curse of dimensionality too great? 
		○ Can we simply paper over the complexity/multidimensionality of these medical disorders? What do docs like Peter Attia, Amit Khera, etc. think?
	• Red Queen hypothesis and the need for maintaining genetic diversity
	• Nature of nurture (e.g., Kong's work, Selzam's work on the reduced explanatory power of PGS's within families)
	• Building the PGSs
		○ Theoretical, a priori beliefs about the genetic architectures of these diseases—how will this impact the necessary sample sizes? How is this related to population genetics. 
		○ WGS and rare variants vs. common variants — will we capture the missing heritability?
		○ In modelling PGT and selection, will the liability-threshold model of disease (a binary model in which those with a risk score over the threshold have the disease) produce significantly different outcomes compared to a more nuanced disease model (e.g., using odds ratios for different percentile bins)? 
		○ Can we expect the genetic correlation between already discovered SNP variants to be equal to that of the undiscovered, rare variants? Or will they have a different correlation structure?
	• What can the extensive animal breeding literature tell us about the feasibility of PGS selection for complex, heritable traits? 
	• Basic measurement theory and prediction
		○ Base rates, detection, phenotypic reliability, etc.
	• How will genetic data be organized and shared going forward? It's remarkable that the data is available for researchers and not being hoarded. 
		○ What is the history of these massive genetics consortia? (e.g., SCZ, T2D, etc.)

Economics
	• Insurance
		○ GINA and the future of privacy
			§ If we develop strong genetic predictors of disease, the financial incentives will be such that insurers won't want to take on those with genetic predisposition. PGSs will be a real boon to actuarial science, provided that the actuaries aren't encumbered by GINA. 
	• How will this technology be financialized? 
		○ Nationalized healthcare services like the NHS, small governments like Singapore, etc.
		○ The history of revolutionary social technologies, e.g. the pill. How will this play out?
		○ Which national healthcare services would be willing to offer wide-scale IVF and PGT for mothers if it were available? What is the process by which such policy could be achieved?
		○ The provisioning of public goods
	• Distribution and inequality
		○ How could this exacerbate existing health, cognitive inequality?
	• Quantifying the positive effects of this technology
		○ QALY's, lives saved, etc.
		○ If PGT and selection against disease were adopted by X% of the U.S. population, how much would this reduce disease burden? What would the cost savings be?
	• Future of sequencing
		○ How cheap could WGS get? What are the economics of scale like? Could it become standard of care if it were to get cheap enough?

Embryology
	• Realistically, how many embryos could we expect to extract per cycle of IVF? 
	• What is the optimal age to do IVF at vis-à-vis successful implantation rate? I believe the peak is around 30, no? 
	• Is the prospect of PGT + implantation even realistic? 

Distant Futures
	• Synthetic generation of human chromosome --> gametes
	• Iterated embryo selection

Other
	• Why are people interested in population genetics, esp. ancestral pop gen? Seems pretty fucking boring unless you're a history nut. Does it have any modern applications? 


		
		
Random Paper Questions
	• Zuk et al 2014
		○ Is enrichment just the prevalence of the allele among cases vs. controls????? And why is it equal to 
So, if we want to know the genetic architecture of these diseases, we need to understand the selective pressures (natural selection, sexual selection) that led to their occurence.
