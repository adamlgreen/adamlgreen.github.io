        <h2> Question to Address </h2>
		<h4> The topics I hope to address can be divided into the following bins:</h4>

			<h3>Ethics</h3>
			<p> Is PGD ethically permissible? How much could it reduce suffering? Is selecting against an embryo with a particular disorder (say, Down Syndrome) an implicit devaluation of the lives of those who have that disorder?</p>

			<h3> Population and Medical Genetics </h3>
			<p> How would PGD work in practice? How useful are PGS for predicting disease? (These are the nitty-gritty questions I hope to dig into.)</p>

			<h3> Evolutionary Biology </h3>
			<p> A priori, is it feasible to select against disease traits without causing adverse consequences? Can we perturb a complex, multidimensional system like the human genome without throwing everything out of whack? S	hould we heed the precautionary principle?</p>

			<h3> Embryology and Reproductive Medicine</h3>
			<p> How difficult is PGD from the perspective of reproductive medicine? What is in-vitro fertilization like for a mother, both literally and emotionally? What percentage of embryos implant successfully and how does this vary with maternal and paternal age?</p>

			<h3> Economics </h3>
			<p> How useful would PGD be from a cost-benefit perspective? How much would it lower healthcare costs?</p>

			<h3> Public Opinion and Policy</h3>
			<p> What does the public think of PGD? What percentage of prospective mothers would be willing to undergo IVF + PGD?</p>

			<h3> Synthetic Biology</h3>
			<p> How far away are we from chromosome, gamete, or whole embryo synthesis? What about iterated embryo selection?</p>
