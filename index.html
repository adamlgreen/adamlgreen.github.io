        <h2>Motivations for the Podcast</h2>

        <p> The growth of the direct-to-consumer genetic testing sector has caused an abundance of genetic data. These data have enabled the construction of genetic predictors for complex, polygenic diseases; these risk predictors will only improve as more data is amassed.</p>
	
	<p> These genetic disease predictors have many clinical applications.</p>
		
	<p> In this podcast, I intend to deeply explore—from all possible angles—one such application: preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) and selection (PGS) of embryos for common, highly heritable polygenic disease conditions (e.g., chronic cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases, which are some of the top killers in the developed world).</p>
	
	<p> Given the potential reduction is disease burden and accompanying increase in well-being, PGT might be one of the most ethically important technologies of the coming decades. That said, PGT is technologically and ethically complex, and understanding the topic requires long, technical conversations (hence why I started the podcast). </p> 
	
	<p> PGT is already technologically feasible—e.g., one company is already offering polygenic PGT disease screening of embryos—and has even made it into the popular press on occasion (see these articles, for example).</p>
	      
	<p> Due to the taboo nature of genetic engineering and novelty , few have honestly spoke out about the efficacy and ethics of technologies like PGT. Thus, a much needed conversation about the efficacy, ethics, and social ramifications of PGT is not being had.</p>
	
	<p> The goal of this podcast is to start such a conversation, encouraging cross-pollination among geneticists, bioethicists, healthcare economists, and other experts, opening up the conversation to policy makers.</p>
