        <h2>About The Podcast</h2>
        <h3>Motivations/h2>

        <p> The growth of the direct-to-consumer genetic testing sector has created an abundance of genetic data. These data have enabled the construction of genetic predictors of complex, polygenic 
          (i.e., affected by many genes) traits. These genetic predictors—called <b>polygenic scores</b> (a.k.a., <b>PGS</b>)—will only improve as more data is amassed.</p>
	
        <p> PGS have many clinical applications. In this podcast, I intend to deeply explore one such application: 
          <b>using PGS for preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) and selection (PGS) of embryos</b>. In particular, I'll focus on selection against highly heritable, common diseases
          (e.g., chronic cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases, which are some of the top killers in the developed world).</p>
        
        <p> <b>Given the potential reduction is disease burden and accompanying increase in well-being, PGT might be one of the most ethically important technologies of the coming decades.</b> 
          That said, PGT is technologically and ethically complex, and understanding the topic requires long, technical conversations</p> 
        
        <p> This podcast will be my attempt to have such conversations. I hope to wade into the quagmires of behavioral genetics, bioethics, and other fields, and to surface some semblance of sense. </p>

        <p> PGT is already technologically feasible—e.g., one company is already offering polygenic PGT disease screening of embryos—and has even made it into the popular press on occasion (see these articles, for example).</p>
         
        <h3> Bona Fides</h3>
        <p> Due to the taboo nature of genetic engineering and novelty , few have honestly spoke out about the efficacy and ethics of technologies like PGT. Thus, a much needed conversation about the efficacy, ethics, and social ramifications of PGT is not being had.</p>
        
        <p> The goal of this podcast is to start such a conversation, encouraging cross-pollination among geneticists, bioethicists, healthcare economists, and other experts, opening up the conversation to policy makers.</p>

        <p>I hope to be a curious yet meticulous interlocutor. The podcast will attempt to broach these subjects at multiple levels of detail, so that 
          the subjects will be comprehensible and interesting to lay-people and experts alike. </p> 

          <p> I hope to rehash how I built up my (still-improving) knowledge of the behavioral genetics, bioethics, and related fields. </p>

        <p>Make sense of our radically changing world, a world which most of us are woefully unprepared for. </p>
