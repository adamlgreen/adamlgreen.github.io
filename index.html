## About The Podcast
### Motivations

Declining DNA sequencing costs have led to an abundance of genetic data. In the past decade, these data have been used to construct genetic predictors of complex, polygenic traits (i.e., traits controlled by many genes). These genetic predictors—called **polygenic scores** or **polygenic risk scores** (**PGS** or **PRS** for short)—are rapidly improving and will only continue to do so as further data are collected.

PGS have many clinical applications. In this podcast, I intend to deeply explore one such cutting-edge application: **preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and screening of embryos prior to implantation—in particular, screening for highly heritable, polygenic diseases** (e.g., chronic cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases, which are some of the top killers in the developed world).

Screening for aneuploidy (an abberant number of chromosomes) and rare, recessive monogenic disorders (e.g., Cystic Fibrosis or Sickle Cell Anemia) is already standard of care for prospective mothers—either if they're undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or if they conceived naturally and are in the prenatal stage.  

However, **IVF and PGD for _polygenic_ diseases vastly increases the scope of prevention.** Given the potential reduction is disease burden and accompanying increase in well-being, **PGD might be one of the most ethically consequential technologies of the coming decades.**

IVF and PGD is technologically and ethically complex. To fully grasp the topic, one needs to understand the following subjects, among many others:

• behavioral and population genetics (fields that are rapidly evolving)
• evolutionary biology
• reproductive medicine and embryology 
• bioethics 
• healthcare economics 


### Taboos and Timeliness  

**We as a culture have yet to start a serious conversation about PGD.** Attempts at such conversations typically become mired in the complexity and novelty of the science (as stated, fields like population genetics are moving incredibly quickly, so it can be difficult to separate scientific fact from science fiction) or bogged down in intractable ethical debates (largely due to the sordid history eugenics). 

**Nonetheless, given that PGD is already feasible**—in fact, [one company](https://genomicprediction.com) is offering polygenic PGD and screening—**such a conversation is sorely needed.**

By having deep, and at times difficult, conversations with leading experts in fields ranging from behavioral genetics to bioethics, I hope to broach the subject of PGD and provide a solid scientific and ethical grounding for future conversations.

My goal is for the podcast to be comprehensible and interesting to lay-people and expert alike. I'll do this by building up from first principles an understanding of the science behind PGD. With this framework in place, we can then begin to tackle the more complicated scientific and ethical issues, issues which will define the future of our species.
