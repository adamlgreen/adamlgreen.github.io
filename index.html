        <p>
        	The growth of the consumer genetic testing sector has caused a proliferation of genetic data. This data has enabled the construction of genetic predictors of disease risk, which will only improve as more data is gathered. These genetic disease predictors have many clinical applications. My idea is to study the efficacy and ethics of one such application: preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for common, highly heritable polygenic disease conditions (e.g., chronic cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases, which are some of the top killers in the developed world). 
	
	Given the potential massive reduction is disease burden and accompanying increase in well-being, PGT might be one of the most ethically important technologies of the coming decades. 
	
	PGT is technologically feasible and has even made it into the popular press on occasion (e.g., there have been a couple of Economist articles on it). There are subject-matter specialists working on the topic of genetic testing more broadly—geneticists working on the algorithms and healthcare practitioners working on genetic testing later in life—but few, except for a handful of bioethicists, are willing to touch the topic of PGT, given how ethically fraught the area seems. (Some healthcare practitioners and geneticists I've talked to have been quite censorious and dismissive on the topic of PGT.) Thus, a much needed conversation about the efficacy, ethics, and social ramifications of PGT is not being had. I hope to start such a conversation, encouraging cross-pollination among these fields and opening up the conversation to policy makers.
