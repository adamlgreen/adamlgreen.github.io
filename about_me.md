## Bona Fides

I'm not an expert in behavioral genetics, bioethics, or any other PGD-related field. However, having read quite a lot in all these fields, I feel I'm in the unique position of being able to synthesize across them. I believe that my curiosity and breadth of knowledge, combined with the depth of knowledge of the experts I interview, will enable cross-pollination among academic disciplines, leading to meaningful growth in conversations about PGD.

### Current Research 

I'm currently working with two co-authors on a PGD-related paper. In this paper, we simulate how much PGD for multiple, genetically correlated disease traits reduces disease incidence; we do this using a liability threshold model of disease.
