## Bona Fides

I'm not an expert in behavioral genetics, bioethics, or any other PGD-related field. However, having read quite a lot in all these fields, I feel I'm in the unique position of being able to synthesize across them. Hopefully my breadth of knowledge, combined with the depth of knowledge of the experts I interview, will enable cross-pollination among disparate academic disciplines. 

### Current Research 

I'm currently working with two co-authors on a PGD-related paper. In this paper, we simulate PGD for multiple, genetically correlated disease traits using a liability threshold model of disease. 

## Funding

I've decided to work on this project full-time. I'm able to do this because of a generous grant from [Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergentventures). Any views expressed on this site or on the podcast are solely my own and do not reflect those of Emergent Ventures or The Mercatus Center.
