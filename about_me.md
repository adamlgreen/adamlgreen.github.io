## Bona Fides

I'm not an expert in behavioral genetics, bioethics, or any other PGD-related field. However, having read quite a lot in all these fields, I feel I'm uniquely qualified to synthesize across them. Hopefully my breadth of knowledge, in combination with the depth of knowledge of the experts I interview, will enable cross-pollination among seemingly disparate academic disciplines.

## Research 

I'm currently working with two co-authors on a PGD paper. In this paper, we simulate PGD for multiple, genetically correlated disease traits using a liability threshold model of diseases. 

## Funding

This project is funded by a grant from Emergent Ventures. They've given me free reign with this project; any views expressed on this site or on the podcast are solely my own, and do not reflect the views of the Mercatus Center.
