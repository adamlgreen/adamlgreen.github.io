        <h2 id="question-to-address">Question to Address</h2>
<h4 id="here-are-some-of-the-topics-and-questions-i-hope-to-address-through-the-podcast">Here are some of the topics and questions I hope to address through the podcast:</h4>

<h3 id="-population-genetics-and-genetic-predictors"><a name="population_genetics"></a> Population Genetics and Genetic Predictors</h3>

<h4 id="genetic-architecture-of-disease">Genetic Architecture of Disease</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How many genetic variants are implicated in the most common diseases (that is, how sparse should we expect them to be)? What are the necessary sample sizes to discover these variants?</li>
  <li>Will most common diseases be caused by common or rare variants? Can evolutionary biology help us determine this?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="population-stratification-and-missing-heritability">Population Stratification and Missing Heritability</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Will high-coverage whole genome sequencing (WGS) help us discover the so-called “missing heritability”?</li>
  <li>Is regressing out the first N principal components of population stratification a good enough way of separating polygenic effects from confounding factors? What about LD score regression; is this a better solution?</li>
  <li>Within-family PGS studies are one of the best ways to control for population stratification as well as environmental effects (especially environmental effects that are passively genetically correlated, like <a href="https://www.genome.gov/Multimedia/Slides/MissingHeritability2018/25_kong_iImpact_indirect_genetic_effects.pdf">genetic nurture</a>). Additionally, within-family studies directly mirror PGD, in that embryos are like siblings, as they have a relatedness of 0.5, and polygenic scores are distributed via meiosis.
    <ol>
      <li>Will within-family studies show that heritability estimates from twin studies are overestimates?</li>
      <li>Will within-family PGS ever approach SNP-based heritability estimates?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>How would you explain GCTA-GREML to a lay-person?</li>
  <li>How can we address lack of PGS portability across populations? Do we simply need biobanks in more diverse places?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="medical-and-behavioral-genetics"><a name="medical_genetics"></a>Medical and Behavioral Genetics</h3>

<h4 id="causality">Causality</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How great a reduction in disease incidence could we achieve with widespread IVF + PGD using our current PGS? How great would this be if PGS’s reached peak predictive value (i.e., SNP-heritability estimates)?</li>
  <li>In what sense do PGS get at causal variants?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="genetic-correlations">Genetic Correlations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A priori, should we expect it to be possible to select against disease traits without adverse effects? That is, can we perturb a complex, multidimensional system like the human genome without throwing everything out of whack?
    <ul>
      <li>Does the fact that we’re selecting among embryos, rather than directly editing the genome, mean we have less reason to worry about this problem?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How can genetics be used to inform nosology (the classification of disease)? For example, genetic correlations point toward a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-018-0217-4.pdf">unitary genetic factor of psychopathology</a>; should this influence how we categorize mental disorders, or is this committing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)">fallacy of reification</a>?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="disease-modeling">Disease Modeling</h4>
<ul>
  <li>For case-control studies, what is the relationship between disease prevalence (K), the genetic sparsity of the disease (p), total heritability, and the sample size needed to construct a meaningfully predictive PGS?</li>
  <li>In modeling PGD, will simulations using liability threshold models of disease produce significantly different results than simulations using more nuanced disease models? (For example, each 5-percentile bin of PGS scores might have an associated odds ratio, whereas in the liability threshold model disease presence is binary.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ethics"><a name="ethics"></a>Ethics</h3>
<h4 id="intuitions-and-permissibility">Intuitions and Permissibility</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How does <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/statusquo.pdf">status quo bias</a> affect our ethical beliefs about PGD?</li>
  <li>Are preimplantation, prenatal, and postnatal genetic screening all equally ethically permissible? Are prospective parents morally <a href="https://jme.bmj.com/content/41/2/175">obligated</a> to do any of these things if they are freely available? How do our ethical intuitions about naturalness affect our answer to this question?</li>
  <li>Julian Savulescu provides a strong case for PGD with his <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12058767">principle of Procreative Beneficence</a>; what is the best counter-argument to it?</li>
  <li>What are the best consequentialist and deontological arguments for and against PGD?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="enhancement-and-history">Enhancement and History</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What is enhancement? <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/04/the-case-against-perfection/302927/">Is it wrong</a>?</li>
  <li>Choosing one’s mate is an indirect form of genetic selection, one which everyone is OK with. Why are many people uncomfortable with genetic selection of embryos?</li>
  <li>Is selecting against an embryo with a particular disorder (say, Down Syndrome) a tacit devaluation of the lives of those who have that disorder?</li>
  <li>How do we reconcile the history of genetic selection with its modern potential for reducing suffering?</li>
  <li>Where do we draw the line between disease-prevention and enhancement?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pleiotropy-genetic-diversity-and-the-precautionary-principle">Pleiotropy, Genetic Diversity, and the Precautionary Principle</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Is genetic diversity an inherent good? For example, one might argue that just as crop monocultures are more susceptible to certain novel viruses, we humans too might be more susceptible to novel pathogens if we increase genetic homogeneity at key disease-related regions in the genome.</li>
  <li>Regarding pleiotropy and unintended consequences, should we follow the precautionary principle and assume that there is no free lunch vis-à-vis biology?</li>
  <li>Certain positive traits (e.g., creativity) are moderately <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590283/">genetically correlated</a> with psychopathologies like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
    <ol>
      <li>Would parents selecting against these psychopathologies also be indirectly selecting against traits like creativity? (This assumes that creativity is highly heritable.)</li>
      <li>Assuming that creativity is a public good, how to we reconcile this apparent assymetry in incentives? That is, how do we solve the collective action problem of maintaining beneficial types of genetic diversity when prospective parents are incentivized to select against it?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="privacy-gina-and-discrimination"><a name="privacy"></a>Privacy, GINA, and Discrimination</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How do we deal with concerns about privacy and the ease with which genetic data can be de-anonymized?</li>
  <li>Will the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) do enough to protect the individual, both in the employment and health insurance contexts?</li>
  <li>What sort of arrangement will intelligence agencies and direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies come to? (For example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/business/family-tree-dna-fbi.html">FamilyTreeDNA shared data</a> with the F.B.I.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="embryology-and-reproductive-medicine"><a name="embryology"></a>Embryology and Reproductive Medicine</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Realistically, in a round of IVF, what percentage of embryos will extract, implant, and come to term successfully? How does this vary with maternal and paternal age?</li>
  <li>What is IVF like for a mother, both mechanistically (i.e., what are the steps) and emotionally?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="synthetic-biology"><a name="synthetic_bio"></a>Synthetic Biology</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How far away are we from chromosome, gamete, or whole embryo synthesis? What about iterated embryo selection?</li>
  <li>How will these technologies change what it means to be human?</li>
  <li>What is the transhumanist case for PGD?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="economics-health-insurance-and-policy"><a name="economics"></a>Economics, Health Insurance, and Policy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Which countries with nationalized healthcare would be willing to provide free IVF + PGD for mothers? Is this something we will see in the coming decades?</li>
  <li>How useful would PGD be from a cost-benefit perspective? How much would it lower healthcare costs? Can we quantify this in QALYs, for example?</li>
  <li>What does the public think of PGD? What percentage of prospective mothers would be willing to undergo IVF + PGD?</li>
  <li>How cheap would genotyping or WGS have to get for IVF + PGD to be a net economic positive?</li>
</ul>
