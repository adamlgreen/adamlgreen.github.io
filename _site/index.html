        <h2>About The Podcast</h2>
        <h3>Motivations</h2>

          <p> The declining cost of DNA sequencing has lead to an abundance of genetic data. In the past decade, these data have been used to construct genetic predictors of complex, polygenic traits (i.e., traits controlled by many genes). These genetic predictors—called <b>polygenic scores</b> or <b>polygenic risk score</b> (<b>PGS</b> or <b>PRS</b> for short)—are rapidly improving and will only continue to do so as further data are collected.</p>
          <p> PGS have many clinical applications. In this podcast, I intend to deeply explore one such cutting-edge application: <b>using PGS for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and screening of embryos—in particular, screening for highly heritable, polygenic diseases</b> (e.g., chronic cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases, which are some of the top killers in the developed world).</p>
          
          <p> <b>Given the potential reduction is disease burden and accompanying increase in well-being, PGD might be one of the most ethically important technologies of the coming decades.</b> However, PGD is technologically and ethically complex. To truly grasp it, one needs an understanding of the following subjects, among many others:
    <ul>
      <li>quantitative and population genetics (fields that are rapidly evolving)</li>
      <li> medical and behavioral genetics</li>
      <li> evolutionary biology</li>
      <li> reproductive medicine and embryology </li>
      <li> bioethics </li>
    </ul>
      
  
  <h3> Timeliness and Taboos</h3>    
  
  <p> Because of the sordid history of 20th century genetic selection and the technical complexity of PGD, we as a culture have yet to have a serious conversation about it. Given that PGD is already technologically feasible—in fact, <a href="https://genomicprediction.com">one company</a> already offers polygenic PGD and screening—the time for such a conversation is now. </p>
  
  <p> PGD is mired in ethical and technical ambiguity. This podcast is my attempt to put the conversation on firm ground. By establishing the technical and bioethical basics of the field, we can begin to have a mature conversation about it.</p>
  
  <p> I will do this by having deep, and at times difficult, conversations with leading experts in the fields mentioned above. My hope is that these conversations will be comprehensible and interesting to lay-people and expert alike. Through them, I hope we all can begin to make sense of our radically changing world, one which we aren't prepared for. </p></section>
