<p>Declining DNA sequencing costs have led to an abundance of genetic data. In the past decade, these data have been used to construct genetic predictors of complex, polygenic traits (i.e., traits controlled by many genes). These genetic predictors—called <strong>polygenic scores</strong> or <strong>polygenic risk scores</strong> (<strong>PGS</strong> or <strong>PRS</strong> for short)—are rapidly improving and will only continue to do so as further data are collected.</p>

<p>PGS have many clinical applications. In this podcast, I intend to deeply explore one such cutting-edge application: <strong>preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and screening of embryos prior to implantation—in particular, screening for highly heritable, polygenic diseases</strong> (e.g., chronic cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases, which are some of the top killers in the developed world).</p>

<p>Screening for aneuploidy (an abberant number of chromosomes) is already <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/noninvasive-prenatal-testing/about/pac-20384574">standard of care</a> for prospective mothers who conceived naturally and are in the prenatal stage. For women undergoing IVF, PGD is used to screen not only for aneuploidy but for monogenic disorders (like Cystic Fibrosis or Sickle Cell Anemia), too, especially if either of the parents is a carrier.</p>

<p><strong>IVF and PGD for <em>polygenic</em> diseases vastly increases the scope of preventive genentic screening.</strong> Given the potential reduction in disease burden and accompanying increase in well-being, <strong>PGD might be one of the most ethically consequential technologies of the coming decades.</strong></p>

<p>IVF and PGD is technologically and ethically complex. To fully grasp the topic, one needs to understand the following subjects, among many others:</p>

<ul>
  <li>behavioral and population genetics (fields that are rapidly evolving)</li>
  <li>evolutionary biology</li>
  <li>reproductive medicine and embryology</li>
  <li>bioethics</li>
  <li>healthcare economics</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="taboos-and-timeliness">Taboos and Timeliness</h3>

<p><strong>We as a culture have yet to start a serious conversation about PGD.</strong> Attempts at such conversations typically become mired in the novelty and complexity of the science (as stated, fields like population genetics are moving incredibly quickly, so it can be difficult to separate scientific fact from science fiction) or bogged down in intractable ethical debates (largely due to the sordid history of 20th century genetic selection).</p>

<p><strong>Nonetheless, given that PGD is already feasible</strong>—in fact, <a href="https://genomicprediction.com">one company</a> is offering polygenic PGD and screening—<strong>such a conversation is sorely needed.</strong></p>

<p>In this podcast, I will talk to leading experts (many of whom I probably disagree with) in fields ranging from behavioral genetics to bioethics. By having deep, and at times difficult, conversations, I hope we can broach the subject of PGD and provide a solid scientific and ethical grounding for future conversations.</p>

<p>My goal is for the podcast to be comprehensible and interesting to lay-people and expert alike. I’ll do this by building up from first principles an understanding of the science behind PGD; <strong>this will involve building up an understanding of behavioral and population genetics, bioethics, and reproductive medicine.</strong> With this framework in place, we can then begin to tackle the more complicated scientific and ethical issues, issues which will define the future of our species.</p>
